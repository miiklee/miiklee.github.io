### Inspiration and Planning
The inspiration behind this project was the Monterey Bay Aquarium seafood watch list. I enjoy how an aquarium is taking the time to inform the public about an issue--i.e. overfishing--and is giving up to date information and steps people can take in addition to creating a space to come and enjoy sea creatures. I wanted to build on this and create something that could be an interactive display in a museum or aquarium type place. I also just love marine life, and am passionate about understanding where our food comes from and what the actual animals we are around are like and why they are like that, so I decided to also do a marine-life piece. 

As for trying to create something that would be a good capstone to this class, I wanted to create something that took elements from all previous modules and blended it together instead of focusing heavily on software or hardware. My original idea would include LEDs, servo motors, and a button all run off an ESP32; it would involve using a laser cutter and 3D printer after modeling and designing everything in tinkercad; and it would have an interactive website which used JavaScript and JSON messages to communicate between a user's interaction with a screen and actual code on a device. This ended up being slightly more ambitious than was feasible, but I still wanted to implement as many aspects as possible.


### Completion
#### Hardware
The hardware used for this project was an ESP32 with a TTGO display, a servo motor and a DC motor run off of the ESP32 and the battery
of an iPhone. Everything was connected using a solderless breadboard. The pinout I used was:

> Servo -- G, 3V, and 36

> DC -- G and 3V

This meant I could control the servo motor, and the DC motor just went as fast as it could. This was very chaotic and I thought
about trying to connect it to a pin and then control it, but part of the running full speed and not getting anywhere helped my
design, so I decided to keep it.

Enclosure design was key to the idea behind the project, so I put the breadboard inside of the iPhone box, and started to make cuts to the
box. I made a cut in both tho inner and outer box to make room for the charge port to stick out. I then cut out a rectangle in the top so the servo motor could sit in flush, and drilled a hole for the DC motor to stick up out of. I also made a hole in the side for a potentiometer to control the speed of the DC motor and completed the wiring for this, but it did not end up fitting in a way that made it accessible to be turned, so I decided not to implement it in the end. 

Photos of the installation can be found in the same github repo linked above. They are not embedding correctly in this page for some reason.

#### Software
The software for this project was not very complicated as all it needed to do was control the servo motor. I wrote code in the Arduino interface
that is uploaded to the github repo above which is a basic loop structure.
