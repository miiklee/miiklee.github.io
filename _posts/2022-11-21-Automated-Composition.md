[game of life](https://miiklee.github.io/game-of-life/)


The game of life is a cellular automaton created by Mathemetician John Conway where on a grid cells can live and die. The rules are as follows:

1. a dead cell is alive in the next generation if it has 3 live neighbors right now
2. a live cell dies if it has anything other than 2 or 3 live neighbors right now

In order to use my implementation, click on any square to change it's life-status and then click "play" to see what the next generation is with those cells as live. At any point click the "play music" button and the notes mapped to the live keys will simultaneously. 

While writing the code for this I got a lot more familiar with the actual rules behind
