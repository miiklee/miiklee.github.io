### Inspiration and Planning:
I started with my favorite TV show _Psych_. In particular, I love the goofiness and camraderie as seen in the 2 main characters Shawn and Gus.
A clear example of their friendship is in the way Shawn introduces Gus with a different nickname everytime they meet someone new. Conversely, Shawn
is almost always Shawn. 

Given the prompt to create something generative with a random component I decided to contrast the hardcoded prompt "I'm Shawn, 
and this is my partner:" with a randomly generated choice from all the names Shawn calls Gus throughout eight seasons of the show and three movies. 
Once I had set on a _Psych_ theme, I went with green and white contrasting to go with the show logo.

I was also focused on the fact that this would be an installation in a high traffic area for a short period of time along with other projects similar to my own.
With this in mind I wanted something simple and bold that would be easy for someone to read out of the corner of their eye, and hopefully put a smile on their face
as they run past. This led me to pick the largest font sizes I could fit and still have all the text, along with light text on a black background because in the
dark elevator lobby it would pop the most. I also made sure the time between switching names was a happy medium between flashing fast enough that in a glance
someone can see that it changes through different things, but still long enough to read what it says. 

### Completion
#### Software
With all the details figured out I went into the process of actually writing the code and putting together the hardware. The software was a pretty basic
loop paired with a random number generator to index a list of options. It was my first time writing anything in the Arduino GUI and in C++ so it took a second
to understand where to begin. The key that took way too long to figure out is that you have to go to preferences and change the editing status of they app
to be able to edit code within the Arduino interface. Once I had the code working hypothetically I played around with different times and font sizes until
I found something that seemed to work well.

#### Hardware
The hardware used for this project was an ESP32 with a TTGO display and a 19V battery. For this to be able to run freestanding, I needed to solder the wires
that came with the ESP32 to the terminals of the battery. In doing so, I accidentally pulled the ground wire out of the battery while trying to strip the wire.
I then had to solder that wire back on, and check with a potentiometer that it still worked (which luckily it did), but it's definitely something to be careful of.
The wires on the battery and the ESP32 are both very thin and my wirecutters did not have a size small enough for them which made stripping the wires a very
delicate process and meant I did not have heat shrink that was quite the right size. These meant it ended up looking a bit messy, but still worked.



### Installation

With all the prep work done, day of installation meant plugging the battery in, and enclosing both devices in a little paper box. I chose to decorate
my box with black swirly lines for no reason other than I thought it looked cool. Similar to the contrast between random and standard in the text, I mimicked
that dichotomy by having very structured and mechanical looking display on the screen with very organic shapes on the box holding it together. To hold the
whole thing together, I used a lot of tape to make sure it would all still in place, attached a string at the top of the box to a popsickle stick, and suspended
it from the ceiling. I did not have a chance to play around with the height it was hanging at because there were many people working simultaneously, and 
the ceiling was too high for me to really see what I was doing in the moment. I had hoped to make it exactly at my own eye level so that someone walking out of the elevator
would almost make eye contact with it, and while that was not true for someone of my height, I am not particularly tall and I'm sure it was true for someone else.
