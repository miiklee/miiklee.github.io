### Inspiration and Planning:
While messing around with the sensors, and trying to come up with an idea for the project, my roommates mentioned that they thought the ESP32 with headers attached looked like a Hexbug nano--a little toy that vibrates around.

### Completion
#### Software
With all the details figured out I went into the process of actually writing the code and putting together the hardware. The software was a pretty basic
loop paired with a random number generator to index a list of options. It was my first time writing anything in the Arduino GUI and in C++ so it took a second
to understand where to begin. The key that took way too long to figure out is that you have to go to preferences and change the editing status of they app
to be able to edit code within the Arduino interface. Once I had the code working hypothetically I played around with different times and font sizes until
I found something that seemed to work well.

#### Hardware
The hardware used for this project was an ESP32 with a TTGO display, a button, a potentiometer, and a joystick. I soldered the wires directly to the potentiometer and button terminals, and made sure they had connectors at the other end to easily slide on and off the GPIO pins on the ESP32.
