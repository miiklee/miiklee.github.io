### Inspiration and Planning
The inspiration behind this project was the Monterey Bay Aquarium seafood watch list. I enjoy how an aquarium is taking the time to inform the public about an issue--i.e. overfishing--and is giving up to date information and steps people can take in addition to creating a space to come and enjoy sea creatures. I wanted to build on this and create something that could be an interactive display in a museum or aquarium type place. I also just love marine life, and am passionate about understanding where our food comes from and what the actual animals we are around are like and why they are like that, so I decided to also do a marine-life piece. 

As for trying to create something that would be a good capstone to this class, I wanted to create something that took elements from all previous modules and blended it together instead of focusing heavily on software or hardware. My original idea would include LEDs, servo motors, and a button all run off an ESP32; it would involve using a laser cutter and 3D printer after modeling and designing everything in tinkercad; and it would have an interactive website which used JavaScript and JSON messages to communicate between a user's interaction with a screen and actual code on a device. This ended up being slightly more ambitious than was feasible, but I still wanted to implement as many aspects as possible.


### Completion
#### Hardware
The hardware used for this project was an ESP32 with a TTGO display connected to 2 servo motors using solderless female-to-female wires. The pinout I used was:

> Servo 1 -- G, 3V, and 36

> Servo 2 -- G, 5V, and 32

The first step I took in creating the physical representation was to make a 3D printed articulated fish. First I messed around until I had designed a fish that I liked. Then I found [these 3D printed articulated joints](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2840744) and used them to segment and then add into the fish I had previously designed. Finally, I added holes at the bottom of the head and tail for it to be held up by later on. 

For the enclosure side of the sculpture, I made a box out of hardwood that was lasercut and then glued together. I left the top unattached so I could easily access the wiring underneath. In the top piece I had included holes for the two motors as well as a 2 holes for bolts to hold a piece of plexiglass above the box. Although I had measured everything beforehand, it did not end up fitting well, so I had to put the wood back in the lasercutter with slightly larger holes. I did not have enough wood to simply cut a new top, so I did my best to line up the wood so it would just cut around the holes that were already there. This worked better than I had feared, but it still was not perfect and then meant the motors did not sit perfectly in the top. I also forgot to put a hole in the side of the box for the usb-c cord to attach the sculpture to my laptop, but I had already glued everything together and couldn't put it back in the laser cutter the same way I had for the top. Instead I used a drill with increasingly large drill bits and a file to make a hole big enough to geth the head of the cord through. Then I screwed the motors into the top, making sure they were aligned and pointing towards eachother.

I then turned to making a plexiglass top to hover above the wooden box. My original idea was for it to be attached in the corners by metal rods, but I didn't find any rods that worked. Next I turned to a bolt with nuts at different levels to hold the plexiglass separate from the box. The design center only had large bolts, so I decided to go for 2 large ones in the middle with 3 nuts each. I lasercut out the top from a piece of plexiglass with holes for the 2 bolts as well as semi circles which would allow the poles holding the fish up to move freely while still preserving as much of the plexiglass as possible. I slid the bolts into the top and held them together with the first nut; then I sandwhiched the wooden top with the other 2 nuts so that the plexiglass hovered about an inch off the main box.

I also wanted the plexiglass to appear like it was water, so I designed a two color water design in Procreate which would leave the highlights empty, and thus would be clear. I did not have time in the end to actually cut the vinyl out and attach it to the plexiglass, but the github repo above has the 2 different files for that design.

To attach the fish I first tried using 2 skewers, but they ended up breaking. Instead I got 4 short metal rods and soldered 2 together to make longer ones. This was much sturdier than the skewers and actually managed to support the weight of the fish. They easily slid into the holes I had made in the fish for this exact purpose, but what was more difficult was attaching the poles to the motors and them actually staying upright. I had hoped to just hotglue them together, but that was not sturdy enough and with the weight of the fish the whole thing would sag. My solution was to 3D print little disks that could fit on the rods just above the plexiglass and prevent them from falling down since there was much less vertical range of motion.

#### Software
The software for this project was not very complicated as all it needed to do was control the servo motor. I wrote code in the Arduino interface
that is uploaded to the github repo above which is a basic loop structure.
