[game of life](https://miiklee.github.io/game-of-life/)


The game of life is a cellular automaton where on a grid cells can live and die. The rules are as follows:

1. a dead cell is alive in the next generation if it has 3 live neighbors right now
2. a live cell dies if it has anything other than 2 or 3 live neighbors right now
